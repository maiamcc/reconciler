# Reconciler

Why am I doing this??? Sigh.

I guess this is a script to help me with account reconciliation in YNAB and various banking platforms.

This is mostly notes to self, but I'm putting it on GitHub because I'm a giant nerd.

## Exporting the Data

### YNAB
- find the unreconciled transactions for the account in question (`Is: Unreconciled`)
- select all
- `More` > `Export`

### Citi
- view transactions for desired date range (click "show all")
- download button -> download as csv
